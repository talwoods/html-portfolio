<p>The visual effects are stunning. It also tackles current social issues like racism in a futuristic way.</p>
<h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
<p>The wildest story ever told. There are many stories that all tie together, with scenes shot out of chronological order. A true work of art.</p>
<h3>The Color Purple</h3>
<p>A masterpiece about the struggles of black people in America, with some of the greatest performances from prominent black actors.</p>
