<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
Hi, I'm Talaina! With a strong background in customer service and a passion for problem-solving, 
I'm currently transitioning into the world of tech—specifically web development and data analytics. 
I'm taking a web development course on Udemy while also building my skills in SQL, Tableau, and Power BI. 
My experience in customer service has sharpened my ability to analyze issues, communicate effectively, and adapt quickly—skills that translate seamlessly into tech.
I love learning, and I'm excited to combine my technical knowledge with my natural curiosity and creativity. Whether it's designing user-friendly web pages or uncovering insights through data, I enjoy the challenge of making information both accessible and impactful.
This portfolio showcases my journey and the projects I'm working on as I grow in these fields. Thanks for stopping by!
